  <h2>Personal motivation for making a Lisp</h2>

  <p>Back in 2018, when the work on LispBM started, I was learning
  about embedded systems both from a software and a hardware
  perspective. During this time, I was introduced to the STM32-Discovery
  board and started writing small programs for it. For a person with a
  background in more high-level programming the
  program/compile/flash/debug cycle of interacting with a development
  board felt very clunky! Moving to embedded/IoT from being more of a
  "Haskeller" was quite a culture shock, not only the clunky
  development loop but also all the wires, all the acronyms (I2C, SPI,
  UART ...) and that the oscilloscope is an absolutely necessary
  debugging tool. It was quite overwhelming!</p>

  <p>As a beginner, one makes a lot of mistakes and an easy task such
  as getting an LED to blink can easily lead to several repetitions of
  the compile/flash/debug procedure. Frustration grew!</p>

  <p>At about the same time I discovered the
  MIT <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J_xL4IGhJA&list=PLE18841CABEA24090">Structure
  and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)</a> video series and
  found the simplicity and beautiful elegance of the language they
  described so very appealing. The language explored in SICP is called
  Scheme and it is a minimalistic Lisp dialect with a focus on
  functional programming.</p>

  <p>When learning something new and very foreign I like to combine it
  with something I am more familiar with. This is where the original
  idea for LispBM started to form. I wanted a REPL on the development
  board and I wanted to implement something like the beautiful system
  they showed in SICP - to make an efficient implementation of a Lisp
  or Scheme-like language for microcontrollers.</p>

  <p>Of course many of the ideas in SICP are extra beautiful because
  they are expressed in the Scheme language itself. To run efficiently
  without using too many resources all of that had to be recreated in
  C.</p>

  <p>Note that while the initial motivation came from the frustration
  of working with embedded systems and the beauty of Scheme, the
  actual LispBM implementation does not follow SICP or any one single
  source very closely. The only Lisp dialect I had any experience with at all
  was Emacs Lisp, which probably also colored some of my initial design choices.</p>

  <p>In detail, motivation and inspiration came from many sources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Garbage collection - from Jones, Lins - Garbage collection ISBN: 0471941484</li>
    <li>Continuation passing style evaluator - <a href="https://lisperator.net/">https://lisperator.net/</a></li>
    <li>Pattern matching system - from earlier functional programming experience</li>
    <li>Message passing system - from Erlang</li>
    <li>Concurrency and process monitoring - from Erlang</li>
    <li>Memory subsystems - long and deep discussions with Benjamin Vedder</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Why Lisp for Embedded Systems?</h2>

  <p>Over the years the LispBM runtime system has changed a lot and many insights have been reached. If we were to take a new stab at motivating a Lisp dialect on embedded systems it would go something like this:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Small but powerful:</strong> A runtime system for a
    Lisp dialect can be made very small (in binary size) while also
    being a flexible and powerful language. Lisp is also expressive
    which means that programs written in Lisp can do a lot while also
    remaining small.</li>
    <li><strong>Easy parsing:</strong> Some complain about Lisp syntax (or lack of syntax) but when it comes to implementing a reader on a resource constrained system and allowing for an interactive REPL it is a big benefit that Lisp is so easy to parse.</li>
    <li><strong>Platform Portability:</strong> While not yet a strong argument, some degree of platform portability can be made possible. This is mainly limited by platform specific extensions to LispBM.</li>
    <li><strong>Rapid Prototyping:</strong> A runtime system that is always ready to accept new high-level code speeds up the programming → running code flow.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There is a long tradition of using a custom Lisp dialect as a built-in scripting or configuration language, think of AutoCAD and Emacs. LispBM continues this tradition.</p>
  

  <h2>From Hobby Project to Production System</h2>

  <p>From 2018 to 2022 LispBM had been a
    personal hobby project without any particularly clear direction or
    aim. In January 2022, we started experimenting with integrating LispBM
    into the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sml8MKaMeSQ">VESC
    BLDC motor control software</a>.</p>

  <p>This started an intensive period of making LispBM more feature
    complete. LispBM already had a lot of diverse functionality, such as
    concurrency, quasiquotation and so on. Focus had been on those
    implementation details and algorithms that I found interesting and
    fun, but really basic things such as negation were missing.</p>
  
  <p>From this point onward LispBM has matured and grown together with
     the VESC ecosystem of hardware solutions. Apart from substantial
     extension libraries for the VESC BLDC software and the VESC Express
     family of firmwares, the following additions and improvements to the
     LispBM runtime system come from the challenge of making LispBM a
     more complete scripting language for the VESC platform:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Time-based scheduling</li>
    <li>Defragmentable memory areas</li>
    <li>Graphics and TTF font libraries</li>
    <li>Image subsystem</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In addition to the above-mentioned major additions, now that we
     had users, numerous bugs were discovered and fixed! Focus has
     increased on correctness as can be seen by the size of the test
     suite and in the static analysis tools used. The aim and goal of
     LispBM is now to be a sandboxed, efficient, small, correct and
     bug-free language and runtime system.</p>

  <p>A question we often get in relation to LispBM being a part of the
    VESC software is: Why didn't you pick uPython instead? My answer to
    this is that I think both I and Benjamin are very happy that we
    chose to build something from scratch. A more established system
    would probably have been even harder for us to adapt to the specific
    requirements of the VESC software. I hope that by building something
    uniquely suited to the VESC situation, we have also created
    something of general applicability.</p>

  <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

  <p>This journey from frustrated embedded developer to LispBM implementor
    has been supported by many people. Benjamin Vedder's willingness to
    experiment with integrating LispBM into VESC software was the
    turning point that gave the project real purpose and direction.
    I am infinitely grateful.
  </p>

  <p>The VESC community deserves special recognition for being patient
     early adopters, providing invaluable bug reports, and pushing LispBM
     to become more robust. Every crash report and feature request has
     made LispBM better.</p>

  <p>Finally, thanks to all the open source contributors, the computer
     science researchers whose work inspired LispBM's design, and anyone
     who has taken the time to try LispBM on their own projects.</p>
